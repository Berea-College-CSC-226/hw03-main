### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward,
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
turtle.backward(negative value)
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current
   location?

```
turtle.position()
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?

```
turtle.speed(0)
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu?

```
color("xanadu")
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
fillcolor("xanadu")
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
To create a local repository that can be changed and synced as needed.
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
The original repository is on Github, but the cloned version exists on the machine. The two are different until synced.
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
A commit is essentially an update/patch. The commit message exists to serve as a log for what is different in each version.
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
The code is being pushed from the local repo to the Github repo. It's the "syncing" mentioned earlier.
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
To make sure the content that's in the "base" Repo matches the current repo, but does not undo new changes.
It aids in consistency.
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others?

```
   At least two dozen. I added mine.
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    No, they are not different.
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still
     there? Did it change?

```
    No, it did not change.
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    My file is in the place it always is?
```

## SECTION 5
- A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully
  understanding them. Your last task is to formulate a question and ask it.
  To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the instructor
  will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:

```
    I'm putting this question down for the sake of section 5. How exactly do Github branches factor into our assignments? 
    And how do you keep track of which branch you're on or previewing?
```
