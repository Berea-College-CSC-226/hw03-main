### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
    turtle.fd() or even turtle.backward() or .bk() if the turtle is in the correct orientation
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    turtle.pos()
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    By setting the turtles speed to 0, meaning no animation takes place
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    turtle.pencolor(115, 134, 120)
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
    turtle.fillcolor(115, 134, 120)
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    Cloning the repo means to clone all of the files and info in the associated repository to a local instance (on your computer)
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    The repository resides in Github, but can be accessed locally by, for example, cloning it. The repository is a storage space for a given project. The github repository is a form of "cloud storage"
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    A commit is essentially the coder's form of "saving" a document. It creates a snapshot of any changes made, with the message helping clarify what the changes might be/why they were made.
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    Pushing your code means to send the committed code from your local computer file back to the remote Github repository. This updates the remote repository with any of the changes that have been made locally. 
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    It is important to make sure that the code you are working on is up to date with any other changes that could've been made on the main branch. 
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    Theres about 16, including main. I see both of mine that I created, as well as all of my classmates'.
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    Yes, any of the pushes that I did on my work already show up, while the main branch is largely unedited for the last few months. 
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch. Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    Replace this text with your answer
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    Replace this text with your answer
```
