## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    Making a copy of the respository from Github and adding it into your IDE or place where you code to have a copy of your own to code in
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    Project that stores files, code, and the history of the project
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
   Commit is the same as saving the task you have completed
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    Pushing means to send your code to your back up source just incase something happens to your code on your IDE
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    So you can recieve all of the updates before send your code in. without the update you could be sending in the wrong information or overwriting someone else's code without realzing it
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    I lost count multiple times but it is between 50-60 including mines and others.
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
  Yes, It doesnt have my branch in it yet
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch. Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
My file it no longer there. I need to merge it for it to be added into the main branch
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    Branching is useful because it is your own copy of the code where you can code all you need to without touching the main product
```

## SECTION 5

A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully understanding them. Your last task is to 
formulate a question and ask it. To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the 
instructor will answer them for everyone! Paste the link to your question in Slack here:

```
    How are you guys able to handle to workload of being a comp sci major while having other classes that have nothing to do with comp sci?
```
