## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    Cloning a repo means making a copy of a repository from GitHub onto your local computer.
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
 A repository is a project folder that stores all the code, files, and history. its  on GitHub remote and on your computer (local) after cloning.```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
 A commit is a saved snapshot of changes in your code.
    The commit message explains what changes were made and why, so others (and your future self) can understand the update.```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
 Pushing means sending your local commits to the remote repository on GitHub.
    Code is pushed from your computer (local) to GitHub (remote).```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    Pulling makes sure your local copy is up to date with the remote repo, preventing conflicts when you push.
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
37 branches in the repo, yes i see mine yes i see others that are active

```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    Yes, they can be different. my branch has my work,the master branch does not 
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch. Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change? 

```
    The files in the Project pane update to show the master branch’s version of the code. 
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
comes back because it exists in my branch. ```
