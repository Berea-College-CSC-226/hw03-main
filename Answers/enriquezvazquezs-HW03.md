## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    Cloning the repo means makng a copy of the remote repository.
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    The repository is basically like a storage location where you can find your
    projects, files, and I'm pretty cettyian that you can look at your history too.
    It exist's in the remote server or where you clone or puch it from. 
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    Committing saves the changes made to a document and saves your progress.
    It needs a commit message because it tells you what were the latest changes 
    associated with that commit.
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    The push takes the commit and sends it to the Git server that it is cloned to.

A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully understanding them. Your last task is to 
formulate a question and ask it. To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the
