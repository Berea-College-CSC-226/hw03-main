3. Name the file `hw03_username.md` replacing `username` with your username.
4. Replace each `Replace this text with your answer` with your answer to the question above it.

## SECTION 1

1.a. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color purple. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    The vales were: R (182), G (93), and B (220) to create the color purple
    (#B65DDC)
```

1.b. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color brown. 
     What are the R, G, and B values? 

```
    The values were: R (98), G (54), and B (10) to create the color brown.
    (#62360A)
```

1.c. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color xanadu. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    The values were: R (100), G (127), and B (111) to create the color xanadu.
    (#647F6F)
```

### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
    An alternative command to move the turtle forward is turtle.fd().
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    The command that can be used to print the turtle's current location is 
    turtle.position() or turtle.pos().
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    You put the command turtle.speed() and set the speed to 0 because that makes it 
    go the fastest.  
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    Once you create your turtle and name the turtle, I will use (t) you 
    would set up the command t.colormode(225) because that is the default and then
    on the next line you will put t.color( 100, 127, 111). This works because in the 
    parenthases with the 3 numbers represent (r, g, b).
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
    You need to use the command fillcolor(100, 127, 111). Befor your shape there
    should be begin_fill() and after there should be a end_fill() commands. (the name
    of your turtle should be before those commands followed by a period.

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    Cloning the repo means makng a copy of the remote repository.
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    The repository is basically like a storage location where you can find your
    projects, files, and I'm pretty cettyian that you can look at your history too.
    It exist's in the remote server or where you clone or puch it from. 
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    Committing saves the changes made to a document and saves your progress.
    It needs a commit message because it tells you what were the latest changes 
    associated with that commit.
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    The push takes the commit and sends it to the Git server that it is cloned to.
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    It is important to pull before you push so that you are in sync with the main. 
    You will have the changes of the main to your branch. 
 
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
   There are currently 17 branches in the repository. I do see mine and the other 
   branches. 
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    Yes they are different because mine has been edited. Under the Answers file mine 
    has this in it but on the main the are no files under the Answers file. 
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    It is not there. It went back to the original state that it was in before my 
    changes. 
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    Yes my file is back. Branching is useful because it allows us to keep an original
    copy with out any edits so that if you can refer back to it if needed. Branching 
    also allows us to work on the main with out changing it so that people can 
    collaborate and work on in independintly and more efficiently.   
```

## SECTION 5

A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully understanding them. Your last task is to 
formulate a question and ask it. To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the 
instructor will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:
