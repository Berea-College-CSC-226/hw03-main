     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    R - 171, G - 54, B - 163

### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
    Move the turtle forward by the specified distance, in the direction the turtle is headed.
    I can use command turtle.fd(distance) or turtle.backward(-distance).
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    turtle.position()
    Return the turtle’s current location (x,y)
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    either turtle.speed(10) or turtle.speed('fast')
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    turtle.pencolor(115,134,120)
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
    turtle.fillcolor((115,134,120))   or  turtle.fillcolor('xanadu')
    turtle.begin_fill()
    ...
    turtle.end_fill()
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    Clonning means to make a copy of the project from the cloud to your local pc.
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    Repository is the space in the cloud where the project is saved. It exists in github and can be cloned to the local machine.
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    Commit is the git command to save changes in the project on your local machine. It needs a commit message, so you and other developers can understand what was changed. 
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    Push means submitting your code to the repository. It is being pushed from your local machine to the repository (git cloud)
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    To ensure that before pushing you will have the most updated version of the file.
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 
     
```
    There is master branch and my branch. Apart from that I can see 50-ish remote branches
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    Yes, they are different. Mine has answers file and hw03 file.
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    When I changed branch to the master, I saw my and other student's files. 
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    My files are still in my branch. 
    Branching is useful for writing your own code without affecting the main version of the fact
```

## SECTION 5
- A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully 
  understanding them. Your last task is to formulate a question and ask it. 
  To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the instructor 
  will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:

```
    I don't have any questions
```
