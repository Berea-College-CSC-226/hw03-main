## SECTION 1

1.a. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color purple. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```

```

1.b. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color brown.

```
    R = 150 B = 0  G = 75
    
```

1.c. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color xanadu. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    R = 115 B = 120  G = 134
```

### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
    An alternative command would be turtle.fd
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    You can use the commad turtle.position or turtle.pos.
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    To set turtle to the fastest speed you hae to use the command turtle.speed() then set () to 0 for the fastest
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    Use the command turtle.color('xanadu) to change the turtle's color
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
   I would use the command turtle.begin_fill and choose a color then instruct the turtle what to fill, after that I would end
   it with turtle.end_fill
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    It means you are making a copy of a repository that is your own and not the main one
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    the repository is where all your code goes and is stored in Github
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    Commit is like a checkpoint for your code to save your progress if you need to work on it later. It needs a commit message
    so that you know what you finished previosly and makes it easy to find your place from last time.
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    When you push you are saving progress and storing your code somewhere else, for us we are storing it in github servers.
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    It is important to pull before you push so that if there is already work on it then you are not wasting doing that and can work
    off what has already been done, then you push.
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    There are as many branches as there needs to be your use. I have two branches that I am currently using.
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    They are different because one is the master copy that other students are looking at while my branch is the one I am currenlty 
    working. Master branch also has the work of everyone that has been working on the code
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    When I checkout the master branch everything that I did is also on there. but the main stuff is still remaining.
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    Branching is useful because it allows you to work on something seperatly without interferencing and then you can merge it later with other 
    partners. 
```

## SECTION 5

A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully understanding them. Your last task is to 
formulate a question and ask it. To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the 
instructor will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:

```
    When doing a pull request, would the everyone's work be transferred to our own separate projects?
```
