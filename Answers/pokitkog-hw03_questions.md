Please replace each `Replace this text with your answer` 
with your answer to the question above.

## SECTION 1: 

1.a. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color purple. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    A type of purple I created was: #8A2191, the R-value: 138, G-value: 33, B-value: 145.
```

1.b. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color brown. 
     What are the R, G, and B values? 

```
    The brown #5E3008 was created with the R-value: 94, the G-value: 48, and the B-value: 8.
```

1.c. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/ "‌"), create the color xanadu. What are the R, G, and B values?

```
   I got #7F9F86, which is R-value: 127, G-value: 159, and B-value: 134.
```

### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
    turtle.fd() could be used instead of turtle.forward
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    turtle.position() or turtle.pos()
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    turtle.speed(0) #fastest is 0, while 10 is fast, and 1 is slowest.
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    turtle.color("#7F9F86")
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
   turtle.fillcolor("#7F9F86")
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    Creating a copy of the repository from GitHub to Pycharm
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    A repo is a space where the code is stored; original repository version is located on GitHub, and after cloning it can exist on local machine.

```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    A commit is the part where you save the current changes in your code, and by leaving a message it helps future you (or other coding partners) to understand what those changes were.

```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    When you push your code you send the local changes to Github so that it can be accessed by others from the server for review.
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    If you push before you pull, you may encounter merge conflicts because your code may not be in sync with the changes made by others.
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    109, yes and I do see others who have committed/pushed
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
   My own branch and the master branch are different as the master only portrays what the professor has initially given us for the homework while mine has my code and work on it.
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    It takes me back to the Master Branch where only the professors work is shown. It isn't in the main folder, the files I work in are still located in my branch.
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    Yes my file is back. Branching helps seperate a teams work from individual. If a group wants to have main components accessible and/or worked on by all, that will be located in main branch while each other seperate branch helps an individual write their own code.
```

## SECTION 5
- A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully 
  understanding them. Your last task is to formulate a question and ask it. 
  To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the instructor 
  will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:

```
    https://app.slack.com/client/T3RM3MK1D/C3QACGH8R
    "My question is if a company is coding a huge project and there are over hundreds of separate branches, how would the main leader in charge of the main branch work on going through all of those separate codes to know which should be applied?"
```
