```
   90 - 35 - 15
```

1.c. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color xanadu. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    80 - 130 - 98
```

### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
    Turtle.fd()
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    turtle.pos()
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    turtle("fastest")
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    screen.colormode(255)
    turtle.pencolor((80 - 130 - 98))
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
    turtle.fill((80 - 130 - 98))
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    it copies code so it can be changed and altered while not having any effect on main
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    All your code in github is being stored there where more people in the github section can see it.
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    when you commit while coding it will save any work you did up to that point
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    Pushing your code will put your code and any modifications onto the repo
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    So we can have any updated information about the code
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    36 branches
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    They are similar but different depending on what ive done with the assignment
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    When i did it before none of my files were there, and other times i could see my files there.
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    branching is useful because it allows us to compare code with one another and collaborate with each other if we were in one large group.
```

## SECTION 5
- A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully 
  understanding them. Your last task is to formulate a question and ask it. 
  To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the instructor 
  will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:

```
    If we delete a file in pycharm how can we recover it
```
