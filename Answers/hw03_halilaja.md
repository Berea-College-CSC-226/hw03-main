## SECTION 1

1.a. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color purple. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    R: 196
    G: 0
    B: 255
```

1.b. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color brown. 
     What are the R, G, and B values? 

```
    R: 87
    G: 35
    B: 9
```

1.c. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color xanadu. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    R: 115
    G: 134
    B: 120     https://www.rgbcolorcode.com/color/xanadu
```

### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
    Description for forward() says moving the turtle forward by the specified distance, in the direction the turtle is headed. I usually use forward(), but we can use fd() or back, bk, or backward with a negative number.
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    The command turtle.position() or turtle.pos().
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    We use turtle.speed(0).
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    We could use .pencolor('#738678') or .pencolor(115, 134, 120). Either by colorstring or rgb values.
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
    With command .fillcolor('#738678') or .fillcolor(115, 134, 120). Again by colorstring or rgb. But for both question
    d and e we would need to set colormode.

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    Cloning the repo means making a copy of a repository from GitHub onto my computer.
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    The repository is a storage location for code, files and version history in a project. It exists on GitHub as the main version but can also be cloned onto computer so we can work on it.
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    A commit is a saved change in Git that keeps track of modifications made to the files in a repository. A commit message is needed to describe what changes were made and why, making it easier to track progress and understand updates.
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    Pushing your code means uploading my local changes to the remote repository on GitHub. It transfers updates from my computer to the GitHub repository so that others can access.

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    Replace this text with your answer
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    Replace this text with your answer
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    Replace this text with your answer
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    Replace this text with your answer
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    Replace this text with your answer
```

## SECTION 5

A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully understanding them. Your last task is to 
formulate a question and ask it. To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the 
instructor will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:

```
    Replace this text with your answer
```
