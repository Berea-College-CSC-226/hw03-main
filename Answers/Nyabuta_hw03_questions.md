     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward,

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    turtle.speed(), This allows for turtle's speed
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    screen.colormode(255)
    tutrle.pencolor((107,166,117))
