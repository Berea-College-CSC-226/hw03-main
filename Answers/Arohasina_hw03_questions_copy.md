Please replace each `Replace this text with your answer` 
with your answer to the question above.

## SECTION 1: 

1.a. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color purple. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    R: 128
    G:0
    B:142
```

1.b. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color brown. 
     What are the R, G, and B values? 

```
    R:142
    G:85
    B:0
```

1.c. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color xanadu. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    R:115
    G:134
    B:119
```

### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
    forward() Move the turtle forward by the specified distance, in the direction the turtle is headed.
    we can also use backward(-x), then using a negative value moves the turtle forward
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
   print(turtle.position())
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    turtle.speed(0)
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    turtle.color("xanadu")
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
####for example, to fill a circle shape 

    turtle.fillcolor("xanadu")
    turtle.begin_fill()
    turtle.circle(30)
    turtle.end_fill()
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    creating a copy of the codes to your local machine 
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
     a repository is a storage location. It can exist on your local machine (local repository) or in Github(remote repository)
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    to commit is like tagging changes in a document/ code. Commit messages are to records what changes have been made since the last commit. 
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    push saves the changes made. The code is being pushed to github from your local machine. 
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    so you can make sure you have all the updates that have been made to the code. 
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    there are 122 branches as of now. yes, I see mine and I see my classmates' too. 
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    the master branch is the clean version. yes mine ans the master branch is different 
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    my file that contains the code that I just wrote disappear when I am in the master branch
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    Yes, the file is back. branching is useful i think if you want to test some new code but you do not want to include it in the master yet. So it is just like a scratch code until you commit and push and merge it into the master branch. 
```

## SECTION 5
- A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully 
  understanding them. Your last task is to formulate a question and ask it. 
  To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the instructor 
  will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:
