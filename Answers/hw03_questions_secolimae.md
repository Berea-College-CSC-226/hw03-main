# Fully Functional Gitty Psychedelic Robotic Turtles

## Instructions

Please replace each `Replace this text with your answer` 
with your answer to the question above.

## SECTION 1: 

1.a. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color purple. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    They are the values for the set of primary colors (R: red, G: green, B: blue) that compose new color channels. 
```

1.b. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color brown. 
     What are the R, G, and B values? 

```
    R: 150, G: 75, B: 0
```

1.c. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color xanadu. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    R: 115, G: 134, B: 120
```

### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
    The forward() method moves the turtle forward by a specified distance given as a parameter. Other methods that can do the same thing are turtle.fd(), turtle.backward(), turtle.bk(), turtle.back(), and so on.
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    turtle.position()
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    turtle.speed('fastest')
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    turtle.color(115, 134, 120)
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
    I'd first set the color xanadu as above, then add turtle.begin_fill(), draw a shape, and end the command with turtle.end_fill()
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    Making a copy from an online repository to my local device.
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    Repository is the place where we can find our code, files, etc. If we want to work on it, we must clone it from Github to our local machine. That being said, repositories exists in Github firstly. If we want to work on them, we can clone them to our local machine. 
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    Commit is when we push our changes from our local machine to Github. When we do that, we might want to describe the changes we've made. This is the commit message.
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    Push my code means sending my code, changes, and work to an online repository such as Github. In this case, my code is being pushed to Github from my local machine.
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    I think it's important because I can get the most recent changes from others (if any).
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    There's two branches: the master and my local branch "secolimae".
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    Yes. Since I haven't made or pushed any changes in my master branch I'm not seeing my work on there. All of my code and work are in my personal branch.
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    Not really. My work it's only in my scratch branch.
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    Yes, it's back. Branching is useful since I can have all my original work in my master's branch and a copy of it in a scratch branch. In this way, I can work on my code rest assured that even though I might make a mess I'd still have my original code safe.
```

## SECTION 5
- A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully 
  understanding them. Your last task is to formulate a question and ask it. 
  To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the instructor 
  will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:
