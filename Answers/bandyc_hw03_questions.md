Please replace each `Replace this text with your answer` 
with your answer to the question above.

## SECTION 1: 

1.a. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color purple. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    213, 0, 255
```

1.b. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color brown. 
     What are the R, G, and B values? 

```
    101, 47, 27
```

1.c. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color xanadu. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    102, 154, 123
```

### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
    turtle.fd()
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    turtle.pos()
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    turtle.speed("fastest")
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    screen.colormode(255)
    turtle.pencolor((102, 154, 123))
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
    turtle.fillcolor((102, 154, 123))
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    Replicates the code so that it can be modified/iterated on it's own environment without interfering with the main code. The clone can be merged into the main repo to carry over the changes if applicable.
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    The repository is where the code is being stored on Github. It can be accessed by multiple people and iterated upon or otherwise changed.
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    A commit is basically saving your work. If you don't commit, your changes won't be carried forward. A commit message is needed so that you can know what was worked/on or changed, or the current state of the code.
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    To push your code means to force your changes onto the repo. The changes are being pushed to the repo from your clone.
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    So that your code is up to date and you can avoid any merging conflicts.
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    There are currently 116 branches, including mine and many other students'.
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    They are different. Mine has changes from a few minutes ago, while the master branch was updated days ago. My branch is also 1 commit ahead of master.
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    When checking out master, all my changes went away, including my python file that I created. 
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    Yes, my file and changes are back. Branching is useful because it lets you work on changes in their own separate environment that doesn't effect master. If the changes are good, you can merge them into master, but if they are bad or don't work out, you can scrap them and master will be untouched still.
```

## SECTION 5
- A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully 
  understanding them. Your last task is to formulate a question and ask it. 
  To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the instructor 
  will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:
