## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    Basically it is coping what is currently in Github to your machine so that you can work on it.
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    It exists in Github so you clone it into your machine to make any changes.
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    Commit saves the changes you make with a message of what you have done.
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    Pushing moves your code back to Github from your machine so that your partner can work on it after.
```
