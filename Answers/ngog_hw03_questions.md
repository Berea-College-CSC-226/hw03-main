Please replace each `Replace this text with your answer` 
with your answer to the question above.

## SECTION 1: 

1.a. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color purple.

```
    R:162 G:0 B:255
```

1.b. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color brown.

```
    R: 73 , G:53 , B:47
```

1.c. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color xanadu. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    R:142 , G:181 , B:119
```

### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
    Did some research and the command turtle.fd() has the same effect as turtle.foward()
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    You can use pos() to find the current location
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    turtle.speed() is the command you use to make it go faster
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    You would input turtle.color() then the number assigned to it which would be #738678
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
    Import the command turtlr.begin.fill then it should start to begin to fill the shape in.
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    Basically using a link to copy the code to Pycharm.
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    It is a storage location where you store your files it exist in both the local machine and Github
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    Commit in transferring your code to Github and you must leave a comment because in case of a teamwork you need to let that person know what changes have been made
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
   A push saves your code to a Github server, The code is getting pushed from Pycharm and to Github.
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    I think its important to issue a push so that you can get feedback before you submit and push your code
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
   I see mine and there are 113 branches in respository and i see all the other people that have pushed their code
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    No they are the smae everything is merged 
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    Yea it changed everything and merged everything to my file on both branches.
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    It allows me to seprate my work from branch to branch and stay organized and transfer my work easier.
```

## SECTION 5
- A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully 
  understanding them. Your last task is to formulate a question and ask it. 
  To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the instructor 
  will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:

```
    My only true question is how often will we be using the pulling method in this class or will it ever be used in our futures as programmers?
```
