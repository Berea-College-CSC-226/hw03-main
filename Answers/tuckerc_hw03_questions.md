Please replace each `Replace this text with your answer` 
with your answer to the question above.

## SECTION 1: 

1.a. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color purple. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    125, 0, 255
```

1.b. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color brown. 
     What are the R, G, and B values? 

```
    100, 50, 50
```

1.c. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color xanadu. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    115, 130, 120
```

### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
    'turtle.goto()'
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    'turtle.pos()'
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    'turtle.speed(0)'
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    'turtle.color((115, 130, 120))
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
    t.fillcolor(115, 130, 120)
    turtle.begin_fill()
    turtle.end_fill()
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    It means to copy the contents of the repository onto your local machine so you can build or edit it to your needs.
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    The repository exists on Github and it is where the original up-to-date code lives.
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    A commit is like saving your progress - it's a marker of an important change to code. It needs a message so anyone else viewing the commit can see what has changed more easily.
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    To push your code is to upload it to the repository from your local system.
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    So you have the most recent code and avoid merge conflicts.
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    There appear to be 136 branches. I see mine and many others.
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    Yes. My branch contains my homework files that the master branch doesn't. The master branch also contains homework files from one person that for some reason didn't merge into my branch.
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    It completely disappeared.
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    Yes, it's back. Changes from one branch don't affect another branch until you want it to, which provides a failsafe.
```

## SECTION 5
- A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully 
  understanding them. Your last task is to formulate a question and ask it. 
  To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the instructor 
  will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:
