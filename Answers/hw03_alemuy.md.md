### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
t.fd()
Both turtle.forward(distance) and turtle.fd(distance) do the same thing.

```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
t.pos()
(or t.position() — both return the (x, y) coordinates).
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
t.speed(0)
0 is the “fastest” setting.
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
t.color((115, 134, 120))
Make sure you set screen.colormode(255) first so 0–255 values work.
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
t.fillcolor((115, 134, 120))
t.begin_fill()
# draw your shape here
t.end_fill()
```
