### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

   location?
   
```
    turtle.position()
    turtle.pos()
```

```
    turtle.speed(speed=None)
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    turtle.pencolor(57,142,119)
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
    turtle.fillcolor(57,142,119)
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    When you clone a repository, you copy the repository from GitHub.com to your local machine, or to a remote virtual machine when you create a codespace.
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    
A repository is essentially a storage space where your project files, including the code and related assets, are kept. 
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    Replace this text with your answer
```

A commit is a snapshot of your changes in a Git repository, which  represents a set of changes you've made to the code or project files that are saved in the version control system

- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    To push your code means to upload your local changes (commits) from your local Git repository to a remote repository
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    Itâ€™s important to "pull" before you "push" to ensure that you're working with the most up-to-date version of the codebase and avoid conflict
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    28, yes I see mine and others
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    Yes, in mine there are files like Answers and a python file with my program
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    It went back to the version when I just cloned the repo 
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    Yes, my changes are still here. Branches are useful to save the code and do not make merge conflicts
```

## SECTION 5

A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully understanding them. Your last task is to 
formulate a question and ask it. To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the 
instructor will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:

```
