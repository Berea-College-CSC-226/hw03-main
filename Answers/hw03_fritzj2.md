## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
   It is important to do this to make sure that the code you have written is aligned with the new version of the main.
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
   There are currently 13 requests that I can see. I do in fact see mine after the pull request.
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    There are two codes that are different and they do happen to be the ones that I have added.
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch. Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    There are now the other branches that other people have made. There is also now a #207 next to my branch that align with the pull request.
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
   It is nice to see how many branches you have made in Pycharm. The thing that I like is that it gives you the last pushed revision to gitHub.
```
