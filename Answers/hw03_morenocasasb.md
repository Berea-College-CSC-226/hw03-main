### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the
`forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward,
besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
turtle.fd()
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current
location?

```
print(turtle.position())
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?

```
The speed of the turtle depends on how slow (1) snd how fast (10) you want your turtle to move. Such as adding this command "turtle.speed(7)"
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu?

```
turtle.color(118, 149, 122)
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
turtle.color(118, 149, 122)
turtle.begin_fill()
...
turtle.end_fill()
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
Cloning the repo would mean to make my own copy of the repo, but in a different branch name. Kind of like the way we use Google Docs.
```

- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
The repository is like a project. It could exist anywhere (like a folder) you want to work on.
```

- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
Committing is like showing what you currently have, whether it's a draft or it's finished. Commit messages can be used to describe or write what is associated with what you're committing to.
```

- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
To push your code means to send your code to Github instead of keeping it inside the computer.
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
We can pull our code from Github so that you can see if there is any changes or suggestions being made. Then we push so we can give what we currently have of our code (as in any changes we've made or added some things).
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others?

```
I know that there are 2 class period worth of branches including the main/master. I see mine and I also see others!
```

4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
They are different. My branch has my own editing while the master branch is basically like a template.
```

4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the
master branch.
Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still
there? Did it change?

```
My project is still there, but inside the "Answers" folder. Nothing changes, except when it's blue because it indicates that I'm changing something in the file.
```

4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
here, describe how branching is useful:

```
My files are there in the "Answers" folder. It doesn't have the changes I'm doing now before the previous commit and push.
```

## SECTION 5

A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully understanding them. Your last task is to
formulate a question and ask it. To do this, put your question into
the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the
instructor will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:

```
Is there anything I need to look after the pull request?
```
