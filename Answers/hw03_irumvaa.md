1.a. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color purple.
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    rgb(128, 0, 128). R,G, and B values represent how much of each color is in the combination to make the color
    purple. r= red, G = green, and b=blue
```

1.b. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color brown.

    You can use turtle.fd()
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current
   location?

```
    print(turtle.pos())
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?

```
    turtle.speed(0)
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu?

```
    turtle.color(115, 134, 120)

    turtle.fillcolor(115, 134, 120)
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    Cloning the repo means bring the project code from GitHub to your local computer.
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    The repository is where all your work is stored. it exist in Github and on your local machine after you
    clone it.
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    A commit helps programmers save they code they have created or changed made in the
    loccal machine. Commit messages are like tags, they help you know what was your last change and maybe why
     you made the change.
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    To 'push' your code means to send all your cimmited changes to Github from your local machine.

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
      It is importnat to pull before pushing becuase there might be changes made by others in git, if you don't pull
    , it can create merge conflict. Pulling upadats your local branch to make sure it is simlar the the 
    remote main branch.
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others?

```
    There is the main branch and 47 other branches. yes I see my branch, and those of my classmates.
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    My branch contains the file I created and the changes I made for this assignment, while the main branch
     contains combined version of the project.
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the
     master branch. Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still
     there? Did it change?

```
    When I checked out the master branch, I was no longer able to see my file in the project pane.
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
   When I switched back to my branch, my file was back. Branching helps you no overwrite somebody's else work.
   A lot of programmers have access to the master branch, so creating a new branch helps them do some testing
   without changing the master branch.
