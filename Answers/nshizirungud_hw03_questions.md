### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
   turtle.fd()
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    turtle.pos()
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    turtle.speed("fastest")
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    screen.colormode(255)
    turtle.pencolor(102,154, 123)
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
    turtle.fillcolor(102,154, 123)
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    Cloning the Repo means were making our own personal copy of the code to our computers without changing the Original copy. 
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    The repository is the place the code os being stored in Github. It can exist on your local machine where it includes your .git It also exists in Github as a remote repository as a sort of backup.
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    A commit is essentially you saving your code or whatever you changed in your clone. A commit message is needed so other people who are programming with you can know what changes you made to the code and they can easily pick off where you left off.
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    You are pushing from you local repository where you made the changes to the remote respository where people can view your changes. 
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    I'ts important to pull before you push to not cause merge conflicts. If your teammate made changes to the same file as you and you both pushed without confirming the updates youll get a merge conflict. This can all be avoided however if you pulled and confirmed your partner made changes before you push. 
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    Currently there are 134 branches including mine 
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    Yes there are differences from the master branch and mine. The master branch doesn't have any writing or changes I made in my branch 
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    All my work went away including any files I had created. 
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    When I go back to PyCharm the changes that I made are still here including any files I made. Branching is useful in the sense that if you made a change in the branch it would not affect the master branch. This allows you to practice on scratch files and whenever you think you have something you can at last incorporate it into the master branch and if you don't you can keep working on the other branches. 
```

## SECTION 5
- A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully 
  understanding them. Your last task is to formulate a question and ask it. 
  To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the instructor 
  will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:
