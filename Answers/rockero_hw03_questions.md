Please replace each `Replace this text with your answer` 
with your answer to the question above.

## SECTION 1: 

1.a. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color purple. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    (171, 0, 255)
```

1.b. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color brown. 
     What are the R, G, and B values? 

```
    (87, 79, 92) 
```

1.c. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/). 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    (115, 134, 120) makes the color Xanadu
    
    used to find the color: https://www.color-hex.com/color/738678
```

### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
    You could use tutle.fd() method
    or
    You could use turtle.backward() method with a negative value
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    You can use the pos() method and the write() method to display the position
    while using the turtle module.
    
    example
    position = turtle.pos()
    turtle.write(position)
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    by using the speed(0) method with the value of 0.
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    Replace this text with your answer
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
    1. by setting the fill color to xanadu: t.fillcolor(115, 134, 120)
    2. by using the begin_fill() method before crafting a shape.
    3. by using the end_fill() method after finishing the shape.
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    It lets you make a copy on your computer so you can work on it on your environment.
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    It can exist on github and we can clone it into our computer. A repository has all the files of a program and it
    shows the different versions (updates to that code) so you can implement changes or revert at any time.
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    A commit captures the current state of your files so you can save it as a certain version of the repository 
    after you've made changes. Commit messages are crucial because they let us know what that certain version of our
    repository achieved / what changes where made.
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    Pushing code is sending the changes we've made to a remote repository we can access on the cloud (github).
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    Because that updates your computer's version of the program so its synchronized with github, then you implement your changes.
    If you do it backwards you could create merge conflicts if someone else has also made changes and tries to push as well.
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
   118 branches. I can see mine and the others.
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    They are different branches. Mine is a copy of the main branch with the added edits
    I've made since working on this assignment.
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    It closed the copy of the questions on my branch because it didnt exist in the main branch.
    I was able to open it again after checking out my branch again.
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
   It's very useful so everyone can work on a different version of an existing codebase
   and implement changes as needed. 
```

## SECTION 5
- A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully 
  understanding them. Your last task is to formulate a question and ask it. 
  To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the instructor 
  will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:
