### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
The turtle library describes forward as "Moves the turtle forward by the specified distance, in the direction the turtle is headed." You can also use turtle.fd() to move the turtle forward.
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    You can use turtle.pos or turtle.position
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    You can set it to maximum by putting the speed as 0.
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
turtle.colormode(255)
turtle.color(105, 139, 105)
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
turtle.colormode(255)
turtle.color(105, 139, 105)
turtle.begin_fill()
turtle.circle(80)
turtle.end_fill()
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    cloning is the same as creating a copy of the repo on git on your local device.
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    The repository is a folder with multiple files that exists on Github.
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    A commit is done when you've completed some steps and want to save that version of your code to save your progress. It needs a commit message so you and other people can know what work was completed at that point.
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    Pushing code means updating the repo on git with the changes you've made on your local device.
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    I think it is important to pull before you push so that when you push you don't have merge conflicts with the version of the file that's on github.
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    There are 112 branches. I do see mine, and I can look at all the other branches in the repo if I like.
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    Yes, they are different. My branch has answers to the questions, my code, and an image file added to it.
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    My file disappeared. Further, if I hadn't commited my changes to this file, my work might have disappeared I think.
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    Yes, my file is back. Branching is useful because it can allow a lot of people to have access to the same primary information while they change and modify their copies of the primary version.
```

## SECTION 5
- A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully 
  understanding them. Your last task is to formulate a question and ask it. 
  To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the instructor 
  will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:
