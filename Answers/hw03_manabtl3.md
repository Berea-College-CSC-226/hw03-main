## SECTION 1

Replace each `Replace this text with your answer` with your answer to the question above it.

1.a. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color purple. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    rgb(128, 0, 128)
```

1.b. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color brown. 
     What are the R, G, and B values? 

```
    rgb(165, 42, 42)
```

1.c. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color xanadu. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    This is a returning a "Invalid hex color format" because "xanadu" isn't a color in their library
    but searching what hex color format "Xanadu" is it's able to give me "rgb(115, 134, 120)" for the a muted green (#738678) which
    what xanadu is.

### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
    You could also input "fd()" instead.
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    You can type in "turtle.pos() or turtle.position() to tell where the turtle's current state is.
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    turtle.speed(0) 
    “fast”: 10
    “normal”: 6
    “slow”: 3
    “slowest”: 1
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    turtle.color(#738678)
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
    Depending on your shape, you could start on a turtle.begin_fill() and once you're done drawing
    your shape you can turtle.end_fill() which would fill in the shape it drew with the color you stated before hand.
```
