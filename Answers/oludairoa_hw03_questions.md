Please replace each `Replace this text with your answer` 
with your answer to the question above.

## SECTION 1:


1.a. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color purple.
    What are the R, G, and B values?


```
   The R value is 160, the G is 20, and B is 240.
```


1.b. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color brown.
    What are the R, G, and B values?


```
   The R value is 101, the G is 55, and the B is 0.
```


1.c. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color xanadu.
    What are the R, G, and B values?


```
   The R value is 115, the G is 134, and the B is 120.
```

### SECTION 2


2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the
    `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward,
    besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?


```
   The alternate command used to make a turtle move forward is fd()
```


2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current
  location?
 
```
   The command that can be used to print the location of a turtle is turtle.position() or
   turtle.pos()
```


2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
 
```
   We would make use of the speed() method
```


2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu?


```
   I would run the command turtle.color("xanadu") with turtle being a variable created
```


2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?


```
   I would use the fillcolor() method and do something like turtle.fillcolor("xanaud") and then I would need to place the begin_fill() and end_fill() methods at the appropriate sections in the code.

## SECTION 3


3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?


```
   Cloning the repo is the process of creating a personal copy of a pre-existing file of code
```




- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?


```
   The repository is the github storage area for all related code and files. It exists in github and can be accessed from any computer device that has the repo link.
```




- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?


```
   A commit is the process of saving code to ones personal computer for later use
```




- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?


```
   Pushing the code is the process of sending saved code to the guthub repository to be stored so others can use the working code later on. It is being pushed to the github repository and from your commit.
```

## SECTION 4_oludairoa


## Pull Master Into Your Local


4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?


```
   Pulling before Pushing is important because you need to make sure you have the most up to date version of a file before saving your changes. This makes it so if you are working on a team no ones progress is lost.
```


4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
    Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others?


```
   Yup. I see mine and i see lots of others. At the time of answering this question there are 126 branches.
```




4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?


```
   My branch has the file that I created to add my code but the master does not.
```




4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the
    master branch.
    Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still
    there? Did it change?


```
   I recieved a message saying that my changes to this file would not save if i proceeded with the checkout.
```




4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
    here, describe how branching is useful:


```
   Branching allows for the creation and storing of separate code so that it can be accessed by the master later ONLY if it works and without overiding already working code.
```

## SECTION 5
- A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully
 understanding them. Your last task is to formulate a question and ask it.
 To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the instructor
 will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:
