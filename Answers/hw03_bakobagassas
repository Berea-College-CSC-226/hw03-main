### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
 the alternate command that can be used to move the turtle forawrd is: turtle.fd(distance)
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    turtle.position()
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    turtle.speed(0)
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    turtle.color(xanadu)
    or
    turtle.color(102, 148, 125)
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
    turtle.color(102, 148, 125)
    turtle.begin_fill()
    turtle.shape()
    turtle.end_fill()
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
  Cloning the repo means making an identical copy of a file/folder from Github to the computer.
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
   The repository is were our work is being stored, it first exists in Github then we can clone it
   into our machine.
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    A commit is when we save any progress we have made on our work. It needs a message so that we can come
    back to each previous version as needed.
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    Pushing our code means that any changes we made will be saved to the Githubâ€™s servers themselves from our
    local machine. This also enables other people which our repository link to access our work.

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    So that if a collaborator made any changes when we were away then we can access them before starting to work.
    This also enables us to avoid working on something they already worked on because it will cause an issue when
    it will come to pushing our work.
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    I can see 8 branches in the repository. Yes, I can see them.
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
   Yes they are different. The master branch does not have the changes that I made in my branch.
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    The main
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    Replace this text with your answer
```

## SECTION 5

A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully understanding them. Your last task is to 
formulate a question and ask it. To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the 
instructor will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:

```
    Replace this text with your answer
