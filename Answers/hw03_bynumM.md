## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    making a copy of the repository data that github has
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
   A repsitory is a storage location used to store your code. It is used often as a back up incase you loose your files on the site you are coding. It is located in the .git section under the file name.
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    A comit is like saving your data from what you have completed. A commit needs a message so you would find the files easier and to know what yuo have done. WIth knowing, you can jump back into a file knowing what next you have to do. 
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    To push mean to send it to the remote. In this case we sent it to github where we push to and pull from
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    It is important because pulling updates your code to have everyone's input. You may work on one line while others work on theirs. You will need to get their lining of code as well to update your side of the codes 
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    2 in this repostiroy. The brances consist of the main branch(file) and the copies of it. I see the main branch and my branch.
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    The branches are different because in my branch I have questions answred and coding 
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch. Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    It changed in the way where I see where I have made edits on my copy but not on the main branch
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    Yes I see my file
```

## SECTION 5

A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully understanding them. Your last task is to 
formulate a question and ask it. To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the 
instructor will answer them for everyone! Paste the link to your question in Slack here:
