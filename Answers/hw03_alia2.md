   location?
   
```
pos() and position()
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
It means making a full copy of a repository from GitHub to your own computer. 
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
It is where the code and the histor of it is stored, It is on GitHub and the local comupter.
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
Saving your work at an important point. Needs the message to describe the what you did so you and anyone else reading 
can understand the history.
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
You send the changes you committed from your personal cumputer to the online repository like in GitHub so others can see

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
It makes sure that my local branch has the newest changes from GitHub so that there are
no merge conflicts.
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    There is the main branch and them my brancg which is hw03_alia2. I can see my branch
    and others that were created.
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    They are different because mine has my code i wrote for the shark but the main one does
    not have it.
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch. Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    My files do not exist in the main branch. They only exist in my personal branch. Pycharm is
    showing em what is in the main branch and that does not include my files.
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    My files are there when i return to my branch. Branches are useful because i can make 
    changes and experiment without ruining the main project and it is easy to switch between
    them.
```
