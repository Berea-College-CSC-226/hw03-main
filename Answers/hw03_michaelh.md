# Fully Functional Gitty Psychedelic Robotic Turtles

## SECTION 1

1.a. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color purple. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?
     
```
    R=118
    G=36
    B=242
```

1.b. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color brown. 
     What are the R, G, and B values? 

```
    R=100
    G=68
    B=68
```

1.c. Using the [RGB Color Wheel tool](https://colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/), create the color xanadu. 
     What are the R, G, and B values?

```
    R=44
    G=101
    B=78
```

### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
    turtle.fd()
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    turtle.pos()
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    turtle.speed(0)
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    turtle.color('#2C654E')
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
    turtle.fillcolor('#2C654E')
    turtle.begin_fill()
    <draw shape>
    turtle.end_fill()
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    Cloning a repo means making a personal copy of the main file from gitbub on our computer.
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    The repository is a storage location for your python projects that exists in github
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    Commit is a saving method that tag an important point in your coding process/development. 
    It needs a commit message so that you understand what was changed since the last commit.
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    Pushing your code means coping your saved code (changes) from your local device into github
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    So that you get the most recent changes, if any, from the repository. so that you don't 
    have a merge conflict or accidentally change code that someone else wrote.
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    There are 25 branches. I see mine and others
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    Yes, they are different
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    My files are not in main branch, only the original files.
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    Once in my branch, my files came back. Hence, branching is useful because it is a way to work 
    on codes without altering the main copy of the code
```

## SECTION 5

A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully understanding them. Your last task is to 
formulate a question and ask it. To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the 
instructor will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:
