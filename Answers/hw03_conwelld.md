### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
    fd()
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    position()
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    set turtle.speed() to turtle.speed('fastest')
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
     turtle.pencolor(114, 141, 107)
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
    turtle.fillcolor(114, 141, 107)
    turtle.beginfill()
    turtle.endfill
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    cloning the repository means taking the latest copy of whatever repository you are copying and making it a local one
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    After cloning it is local normally it is in github
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    Commiting is essentailly a save point where you are saying this is what I did here and that is what the commit message is for
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    Pushing your code is taking your code and putting it into github from your local to the main repository
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    So you are the most up to date therfore insuring no issues with merge conflicts
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    23 branches and I see mine and my classmates
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    Yes one is starred and you can not throw away the main branch
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
   it is gone but now is in the remote set of branches
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    it s not back showing how it is now in the remote and branching is useful as to not have conflicts with all your files missing
```

## SECTION 5

A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully understanding them. Your last task is to 
formulate a question and ask it. To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the 
instructor will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:
