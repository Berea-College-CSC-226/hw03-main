### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
    The given description for the forward method is "move the turtle forward by the specified distance, in the direction the turtle is headed". Another command that could be used is "fd". I am more used to forward than fd.
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    the turtle.position or the turtle.pos can be used to print the turtle's current location.
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
   turtle.speed is used to control the turtle's speed and to get the maximum speed you would input turtle.speed(0), 0 is the fastest speed. 
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    turtle.color(xanadu) would be used to change the turtle's color to xanadu
```

2.e. How would you fill a shape with the color xanadu?

```
    turtle.color(xanadu)
    turtle.begin_fill()
    turtle.circle(80)
    turtle.end_fill()
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    cloning the repo means asking Github to let us make our own personal copy on our computer.
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
  the repository is what we are cloning and it exists on your local machine.  
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    Commit is where you want to save your project, when you want to make a change but you are not sure and you might want to revert the changes is when you use commit .It needs a commit message to indicate were changes were made since the last commit.
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    To push your code means to save your changes on the Github servers, so you or your partners can use the code to continue the software that's being created. Your code is being pushed from your computer to the Github server and your partners are pulling it from the server.
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    To make sure the pull request goes to the right repository and to make sure that the merge doesn't have an issue with the master or other people.
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    I see 136. I see my branch as well as other people's branches.
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    The master branch and my branch are different. The master branch doesn't have my homework on it.
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
    Before I checkedout the master branch, I had made some changes to my branch and I had to commit before checking the master branch. Once I checked out the master branch, I didn't see my things. 
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    Once I was back on my own branch I see all my files. Branching is useful because it lets you pull from the master branch without having to make copies and importing them into your own branch. It lets a bunch of people pull from the master branch onto their own branches for them to edit.
```

## SECTION 5
- A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully 
  understanding them. Your last task is to formulate a question and ask it. 
  To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the instructor 
  will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:
