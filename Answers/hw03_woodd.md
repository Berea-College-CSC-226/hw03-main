### SECTION 2

2.a. Explore the turtle library documentation and find the description for the 
     `forward()` method. What alternate command can be used to move the turtle forward, 
     besides the `turtle.forward()` command you are used to using?

```
   You can use fd() instead of turtle.forward()
```

2.b. What command from the turtle library can be used to print the turtle's current 
   location?
   
```
    You can use the "stamp" to place a dot or shape in the location of the turtle
```

2.c. How do you set the turtle's speed to maximum speed?
   
```
    You can use the "speed" to set the speed of a turtle
```

2.d. How would you change the turtle's color to xanadu? 

```
    You can use the "turtle.color(xanadu)" command to change to 
```

## SECTION 3

3.a. What does **cloning** the repo mean?

```
    Cloning the repository saves the current version of the code or program to your computer
```


- What is the **repository**? Where does it exist (on your local machine or in Github)?

```
    The repostitory is the place in git that stores code that multiple people can use. It is located in Git
```


- What is a **commit**? Why does it need a commit message?

```
    A commit is a way to save your work so you can try something new. Commit messages are needed because they tell us what was changed.
```


- What does it mean to **push** your code? Where is your code being pushed _to_ and _from_?

```
    Pushing your code allows you to save your code to git hub. The code is being pushed from your computer to git.
```

## SECTION 4

## Pull Master Into Your Local

4.a. Why do you think it is important to pull before you push?

```
    It is important pull before you push to make sure your code is up to date with the main in git so their wont be any merge conflicts
```

4.b. How many branches are in the repository?
     Click the link to look at the branches. Do you see yours? Do you see any others? 

```
    there are 11 branches located in the Remote section. I do, its located in the local/recent section.
```


4.c. Compare your branch and the master branch by clicking on each. Are they different?

```
    They are different. My branch has a couple extra files.
```


4.d. Go back to PyCharm, and go back to the Branches interface from before. Checkout the 
     master branch.
     Describe what happens to your file in the Project pane of PyCharm. Is it still 
     there? Did it change?

```
   All of my files have dissapeard except for the ones that were already in main
```


4.e. Now go back to your branch in PyCharm. Is your file back? Based on your observations
     here, describe how branching is useful:

```
    Branching allows for multiple people to create and add files and work together to try and not mess up eachothers work or the main work.
```

## SECTION 5

A lot happened in this assignment, and often, you do things without fully understanding them. Your last task is to 
formulate a question and ask it. To do this, put your question into the [Slack channel](https://bereacs.slack.com/archives/C3QACGH8R) and the TAs and the 
instructor will do our best to answer them. Paste the link to your question in Slack here:
